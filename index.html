<h2 class="aboutustext">Our Team</h2>
	<p class="aboutbody">We are a body of Del Norte students and alumni who recognize the weaknesses in Del Norteâ€™s education and want to help shape it for the better. We believe that Del Norte has the ability to change its curriculum and community to reflect the diverse world we inhabit, and to better prepare students for life beyond high school. This website and all its affiliated activities are run by a dedicated group of volunteers.</p>
